## Inspiration

The worsening of dietary habits among youth appears to have no geographical bounds and improving dietary behaviour has become a critical public health challenge around the globe. Nowadays, there has been an increased interest in games and social media. This raised the possibility of piggybacking on this trend, to nudge youth towards healthier eating habits.

Gamifying nutrition can be referred to as the strategy of employing game design elements to improve dietary behaviour. My project works towards the same. My goal is to make the users more aware of their dietery choices and educate them on how some of their decisions might affect their health.

## What it does

I have built a javascript game called **Health Rider** which works much like the **Classic Retro Car Racing Game** , which we all used to play during our childhood. However, instead of protecting our car from hitting the other cars on the road, in this game we need to make responsible dietery choices to maintain our health in order stay alive in the game.

I have tried to integrate some Augmented Reality 3-D models in the game as well.

## How I built it

I have built this application from scratch using basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I have also implemented **Augmented Reality using EchoAR** to make the application more fun and interesting.
